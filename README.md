This assignment has been nothing but trouble.

After significant help to get past my initial roadblock with the JavaScript code, I spent about 20 minutes typing in all of the questions and answers.

After finishing that, the test was successful in making sure all of the questions worked.

Once the test was finished I went to add comments on what had been completed of the JavaScript. After adding the comments the code broke. I spent the next three hours trying to troubleshoot and asking people I knew in coding for help. By the time the deadline had come to turn in the assignment, I still have not been able to troubleshoot the break.

Console says that the break is within lines 26 and 42, both instances in relation to the innerHTML property.
